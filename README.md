A simple [Alfred][1] workflow for quickly turning on/off Night Shift or setting it to a value between 0-100. No more fiddling with deep settings when you either want to save your eyes or need to work with accurate colors!

## Installation
1. Install [alfred-nightshift][2] workflow.
2. All further updates are handled automatically.

## Usage
In Alfred, type `night` followed by either `on`, `off` or a number between `0 - 100`. In the workflow, you can also set a custom hotkey for toggling.

## Caveats

Some users on Apple silicon chips have reported that the workflow didn't work out of the box. If the workflow is not working, you can try the following:

1. Manually change permissions in settings to allow it.
2. Install [Rosetta 2][5] if you don't already have it on your system.


## Credits
The workflow makes use of the following:

* [nightlight][3] by smudge as the backend for setting the values.
* [OneUpdater][4] by vitorgalvao for handling automatic updates.
